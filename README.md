# README

Hey there, this is a quick weather app project, built in 4 hours with React, Tailwind CSS and a bit of MUI. Just wanted to practice Tailwind. Fully responsive.

## How to run it?

1. npm install 
2. npm start

## What does it do ?

You just type the city that you want to see the weather in and if it's a correct name it will be displayed, otherwise you will see an error modal.

## DO NOT claim as yours 
 
## Hope you enjoy it :)
